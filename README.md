Smart AI-Enhanced Adaptive CPU Scheduler Simulator with Real-Time Visualization 

PROJECT OVERVIEW  
 
This project is a web-based CPU Scheduling Simulator that demonstrates different scheduling algorithms used in operating systems.  
It provides a visual representation of process execution using Gantt charts and tabular results, making it easier to analyze and compare various scheduling strategies.  

FEATURES  
 
- Supports multiple scheduling algorithms:  
  - First Come First Serve (FCFS)  
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)  
  - Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)  
  - Priority Scheduling  
  - Round Robin (RR)  
  - AI(Optimised) choose best Scheduling Processes.
- Interactive input fields for process details (arrival time, burst time, priority, time quantum)  
- Dynamic Gantt Chart visualization  
- Tabular display of process execution details  
- Real-time calculation of turnaround time, waiting time, and response time  
- User-friendly interface with an optimized simulation experience  

TECHNOLOGY USED  

- HTML5: Structure of the application  
- CSS: Styling and layout design  
- JavaScript : Logic for scheduling algorithms and dynamic UI updates  
- Chart.js : Used for Gantt chart visualization  

HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT  

1. Download or clone the repository from GitHub.  
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.  
3. Enter the required process details in the input fields.  
4. Select a scheduling algorithm and click the Simulate button.  
5. View the results in the Gantt chart and data table.  

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS  
  
- Enhanced visualization with animations  
- Support for multi-core processor scheduling  
- Real-time process arrival and execution  
- Machine learning-based scheduling optimization
